Double Ball Powerup: Collects this powerup to spawn two additional balls, increasing destructive power.

Adaptive Paddle: Paddle size adjusts dynamically based on score - grows with high scores for better control, shrinks with life loss for increased challenge.

Locked Brick & Key System: Introduces a special "Locked Brick" requiring a matching "Key" item (only spawns if a Locked Brick exists) for progression.
