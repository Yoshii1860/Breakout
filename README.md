# Implemented Features

Double the Mayhem:
- Power Up!: A brand new powerup emerges – the Double Ball!
- Multiplied Mayhem: When the player collects this powerup, two additional balls instantly spawn, doubling the destructive potential and creating a thrilling moment of multiplied chaos.

Adaptive Paddle:
- Rewarding Performance: The player's paddle size dynamically adjusts based on their score. As the score increases, the paddle grows, offering better control and defense against the relentless onslaught of bricks.
- Strategic Challenge: Conversely, losing a life shrinks the paddle, adding a layer of strategic risk-reward to the gameplay. Players must balance aggressive play with defensive maneuvers to maintain a sizeable paddle.

Locked Secrets:
- Impenetrable Barrier: Introducing a formidable obstacle – the Locked Brick! This special brick remains unyielding until a solution is found.
- Key to the Puzzle: The key to unlocking the secrets held within the Locked Brick lies in a special Key item.
- Conditional Spawn: The Key only appears randomly within the level if a Locked Brick exists, ensuring a solution is always available for the determined player.
